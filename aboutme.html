    <h1>About me</h1>
        <h2>
            Indraneel Mukherjee: From Sales Strategist to Web Developer & Digital Marketer
        </h2>

    <p>
        I’m Indraneel Mukherjee, a passionate and purpose-driven professional based in Gaya, Bihar. 
        With a B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and over five years of experience in the EdTech and media sales industry, 
        my journey has been anything but linear — and proudly so. I’ve worked with renowned organizations like Byju’s, UpGrad, The Times Group,
        and Torry Harris Business Solutions (THBS). I’ve experienced the grind of cold calling, the excitement of closing big-ticket deals, 
        and the satisfaction of leading ad campaigns.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, I believe true growth often comes from introspection and reinvention. After a successful 
        sales career, I chose to pause and reflect. I took a career break to prepare for the 
        Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) — a path driven by the desire to make a meaningful 
        difference in public life. Though I eventually shifted directions, that period became a foundation 
        for my self-discipline, civic awareness, and personal growth.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, I am embracing a new and exciting chapter — transitioning into the world of web development
        and digital marketing, blending technical skills, creative strategy, and my core strength in 
        communication to build impactful digital solutions.
    </p>
    <h2>Professional Experience: Sales with Strategy and Heart</h2>
    <p>
        My professional foundation was laid in the EdTech and media industries, where I held key sales 
        roles at some of India’s top companies:
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Byju’s (2017–2018)</h3>
        <p>
            As a Senior Sales Executive, I managed end-to-end B2C and B2B sales. I conducted educational 
            seminars, visited institutes, and helped launch partnership programs. I gained exposure to 
            Below-the-Line (BTL) marketing, lead acquisition strategies, and hands-on training with sales
            teams — all while exceeding monthly targets consistently.
        </p>
        <h3>UpGrad (2018–2019)</h3>
        <p>
            Here, I expanded on my EdTech experience as a Senior Sales Advisor. I was responsible for 
            course sales, creating sales pitches tailored to lead funnel stages, training new joiners, 
            and deploying email marketing for lead acquisition. My work also included pipeline management
            and cold calling to filter qualified leads.
        </p>
        <h3>Times Group (2019–2021)</h3>
        <p>
            My role as a Senior Sales Executive involved similar responsibilities but with a sharper 
            focus on cross-selling, lead nurturing, and email-based customer outreach. I also began 
            experimenting with sales content writing, creating dynamic scripts for different types of 
            leads, laying the foundation for my interest in content-driven marketing.
        </p>
        <h3>Torry Harris Business Solutions (THBS) – Sales Manager (2021–2022)</h3>
        <p>
            This was a pivotal role that involved more than just sales. I managed B2B and B2C operations,
            led vendor onboarding, and collaborated with educators to build courses that aligned with 
            audience needs. I also became actively involved in digital marketing — creating ad copies and
            creatives, running campaigns on Meta and LinkedIn, and contributing to strategic brand positioning
            and value propositions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through all these roles, I developed a keen understanding of people, persuasion, performance,
            and how data meets decision-making in business environments.
        </p>
        <h2>The Career Break: A Pause with Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            In 2022, I made the difficult but fulfilling choice to step away from my corporate trajectory
            to prepare for the BPSC exams. My motivation was rooted in public service, and I spent the 
            next year immersed in intensive preparation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Preparing for BPSC was a serious commitment. I spent over a year focused on topics like 
            polity, history, geography, and public administration. It was intense, self-driven, and 
            mentally demanding. While I didn’t end up pursuing a career in civil services, the process 
            reshaped my mindset.
        </p>
        <p>
            It taught me the value of discipline, clarity of thought, and a deeper understanding of 
            governance and social systems. Most importantly, it gave me the courage to restart, learn 
            again, and create a new path for myself with complete honesty and dedication.
        </p>
        <h3>Discovering the World of Web Development and Digital Marketing</h3>
        <p>
            As I re-evaluated my future, I asked myself three simple questions:
            <ul>
                <li>What excites me enough to keep learning every day?</li>
                <li>Where can I combine creativity with strategy?</li>
                <li>What industry will always evolve and grow?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The answer was clear: the digital ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>
                I began by teaching myself the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Initially, 
                I just wanted to understand how websites are built. But soon, I found myself deep-diving 
                into concepts like responsive design, DOM manipulation, and frontend frameworks like 
                AngularJS. I'm currently also exploring Node.js to strengthen my backend skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                Simultaneously, I leveraged my sales and advertising experience to explore digital 
                marketing — not just from a theoretical perspective, but from a creator’s point of view. 
                I studied SEO (on-page and off-page), social media marketing, paid ad campaigns on Meta 
                and LinkedIn, and email marketing workflows.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started working on my own projects — from writing ad copies and designing creatives on 
                Canva, to running demo campaigns and testing landing pages. I began crafting a new professional
                identity — one where I’m not just selling solutions, but building them.
            </p>
            <h3>From Sales Expertise to Full-Stack Thinking</h3>
            <p>
                My previous experience in sales gave me a deep understanding of customer psychology, 
                communication, and strategic outreach. These skills translated naturally into digital 
                marketing — crafting persuasive copy, segmenting audiences, building funnels, and analyzing
                campaign metrics.
            </p>
            <p>
                More importantly, the switch to development and marketing has allowed me to approach 
                problems from both the user and builder perspective. I don’t just think about how to 
                drive traffic to a page — I also think about how to design and code that page for optimal 
                performance and experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                This dual skillset — part coder, part marketer, and part communicator — is what I’m building
                into my personal brand.
            </p>
            <h3>Skills I’ve Gained and Applied</h3>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Frontend Web Development: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, responsive design, DOM manipulation.</li>
                    <li>Frameworks & Tools: AngularJS, Node.js, WordPress (Elementor), Git</li>
                    <li>Digital Marketing: SEO, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, Instagram strategy, email campaigns</li>
                    <li>Design and Creativity: Canva, ad copywriting, branding concepts</li>
                    <li>Soft Skills: Communication, team collaboration, problem-solving, people management</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m currently developing Lunar Campaign, a digital marketing portfolio project where I 
                design web interfaces, test marketing strategies, and create brand assets from scratch — 
                a living experiment to apply everything I’m learning.
            </p>
            <h3>Why This Shift Makes Sense</h3>
            <p>
                Though the transition from sales to software and marketing may seem drastic from the 
                outside, it makes complete sense to me. Every skill I built over the years — be it pitching 
                a product, crafting a value proposition, or managing a team — is still relevant. What’s 
                changed is the medium.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m no longer just a facilitator between a product and a customer. I’m becoming the creator 
                of those products — both visually and functionally.
            </p>
            <p>
                This shift has not only been career-oriented but deeply personal. I’m doing work that 
                excites me, challenges me, and aligns with how I want to contribute in the long term — 
                through digital problem-solving, design thinking, and human-centric tech.
            </p>
            <h3>What I’m Looking For</h3>
            <p>
                I’m now actively looking to join a team, internship, or freelance collaboration where I 
                can contribute as a web developer, digital marketer, or creative strategist. My ideal
                work environment is one that values curiosity, experimentation, and clear communication.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m especially drawn to startups, creative agencies, and mission-driven businesses that 
                need hybrid talents — someone who can code a landing page and optimize it for conversions,
                someone who understands both the product and the pitch.
            </p>
            <p>
                If given the opportunity, I bring with me:
                <ul>
                    <li>A real hunger to learn and grow</li>
                    <li>A unique blend of sales, marketing, and development skills</li>
                    <li>A mindset shaped by resilience, self-study, and reinvention</li>
                    <li>And above all, an honest desire to add value wherever I go</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Final Words</h3>
            <p>
                My journey — from selling courses and managing ad campaigns, to preparing for a public 
                service career, and now building web apps and digital strategies — is not typical, and I 
                don’t want it to be.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe in second chances, in learning from scratch, and in the power of self-directed 
                growth. My story isn’t just about changing careers — it’s about owning your story and 
                being brave enough to rewrite it.
            </p>
            <p>
                So whether it’s a campaign to design, a website to build, or a story to tell — I’m here 
                to make it impactful, authentic, and user-first.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let’s build something meaningful together.
            </p>
        </p>
    </p>
